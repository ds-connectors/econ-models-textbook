The incidence or burden of paying the tax will thus fall on consumers moreso than producers.\n",

    "With elastic goods, incidences are distributed in the opposite way. As elastic goods are less of a necessity, consumers will substitute away from them when prices increase. Thus, when the tax is levied on an elastic good and its price increases, consumers will be more willing to switch to other goods, thereby leaving the producer to bear more of the tax-paying burden.\n",

For consumers, the higher price they must pay essentially \"prices\" out some individuals - they are now unwilling to pay more for the good. This leads them to leave the market that they previously participated in. At the same time, for producers, the introduction of the tax increases production costs and cuts into their revenues. Some of the businesses that were willing to produce at moderately high costs now find themselves unable to make a profit with the introduction of the tax. They too leave the market. There are market actors who are no longer able to purchase or sell the good.\n",
