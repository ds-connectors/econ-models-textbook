    "In this question you will calculate the discount factors and yields associated with certain U.S. bonds for various time frames. As discussed in lecture, finding discount factors is essential to pricing bonds and other assets, as typically each time frame has a different yield and each future cash flow must be discounted to the present by its own discount factor. We have generated a .csv file for you, containing pricing information on these bonds, retrieved from the treasury website."

Assuming that each of these bonds pays an annual coupon worth 2% of the face value, and all face values are $\\$100$, then the price of this first asset was generated by\n",

    "\n",
    "You will notice that this pattern is recursive, in a sense, in that to find $DV_i$ you need to know $DV_{i-1}$. Your task for this problem is to find the discount factors for each year into the future, starting at $DV_1$ all the way to $DV_{10}$. You will also notice in the data that there are some jumps in year; for instance, we are missing a bond expiring in 2022. For these cases where we cannot explicitly find a certain $DV_i$, just assume that $DV_i = DV_{i-1}$.\n",
