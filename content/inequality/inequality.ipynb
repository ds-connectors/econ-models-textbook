Mathematically, this is because the derivative is constant: for a slight increase in x, the total share of income increases at a constant rate. Another way to think about this is that the bottom 10% of the population will own 10% of the total income, the bottom 50% of the population will own 50% of the total income, and so on.

Right before the Great Depression, income inequality peaked, where the richest 1% possessing 19.6% of all income. During the Great Depression, top marginal tax rates increased up to 94% by 1944. The top marginal tax rate stayed high for decades, where it was 70% in 1965 and 50% in 1982. These high top marginal tax rates are correlated with low income inequality.

    "A study done by the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/research/whats-happening-to-the-world-income-distribution-the-elephant-chart-revisited/) found that “poorer countries, and the lower income groups within those countries, have grown most rapidly in the past 20 years.” This supports the World Bank’s claim that inequality between countries and within countries is decreasing. The Brookings Institution used only household surveys, however, which usually excludes the top and bottom percentile of the population, due to non-response bias. Still, the study is useful in corroborating the trends and growth in global income inequality. "
