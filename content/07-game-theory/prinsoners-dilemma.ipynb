    "We will study the **iterated prisoner's dilemma**, a game paradigm in which the prisoner's dilemma is played over multiple rounds and in tournaments to determine the best strategy for playing the game. This paradigm was introduced by [Robert Axelrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod) to use the prisoner's dilemma as a lens through which to study the Cold War during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Axelrod created a tournament out of an iterated prisoner's dilemma and invited theoreticians to write programs that could strategically play the game, and then pitted them one against another in a round-robin-style tournament."

Because of this, we would expect that the defector would win every round in a match between these two players, because they will always accrue 0 years where the cooperator always accrues 5.\n",

    "| `Alternator` | Alternates between C and D |\n",

    "| `Desperate` | Only cooperates after mutual defection |\n",
    "| `FoolMeOnce` | Forgives one D then retaliates forever on a second D |\n",
    "| `Forgiver` | Starts by cooperating however will defect if at any point the opponent has defected more than 10 percent of the time |\n",
    "| `ForgivingTitForTat` | Starts by cooperating and defects if opponent has defected more than 10% of the time **and** their last move was defection |\n",
    "| `Grudger` | Starts with C and then D forever on opponent's first D |\n",
    "| `OnceBitten` | C once on opponent D, but if opponent D's twice in a row defaults to D for 10 turns |\n",

If `winner` is `True`, it returns the winner of the match; if `winner` is `False`, it returns a list for each player containing the sequence of years accrued."
