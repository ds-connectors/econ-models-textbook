    "For this projection, we will be looking at replicating an analysis done by Prof. David Card on the effects of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami labor market. Because immigrants choose their destinations (and logically choose places with strong labor markets), it is not enough to look at whether places with more immigrants have different rates of unemployment or wages to determine the causal effect of adding immigrants to a labor market. However, Card determined that there are some circumstances under which immigrants will arrive which have very little to do with the labor market of that place; the Mariel Boatlift is one such event. Here is Card's description:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The experiences of the Miami labor market in the aftermath of the Mariel Boatlift form one such \\[\"natural\"\\] experiment. From May to September 1980, some 125,000 Cuban immigrants arrived in Miami on a flotilla of privately chartered boats. Their arrival was the consequence of an unlikely sequence of events culminating in Castro's declaration on April 20, 1980, that Cubans wishing to emigrate to the United States were free to leave from the port of Mariel. Fifty percent of the Mariel immigrants settled permanently in Miami. The result was a 7% increase in the labor force of Miami and a 20% increase in the number of Cuban workers in Miami. (Card, 1990:245-6)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab, we saw that the Mariel boatlift had little effect on unemployment among ethnic groups in Miami, as the cities that were not receiving \\(many\\) immigrants were afflicted by the same trends in unemployment. We also saw that the same is true of education-level groups. In fact, many studies find that influxes of immigrants benefit the native-born workers in a region; that they act as complements rather than supplements to the native workforce."
