    "At the core of macroeconomics is the study of how a nation's various resources are used as inputs in the production of goods and services. The aggregate value of what a nation produces is known as its Gross Domestic Product, which is calculated in many different ways. The focus of this lecture is on production and the functions that aim to model how much output a country can produce, when given a certain set of inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "These set of inputs are known as factors of production:\n",
    "- K: Capital - a monetary value of the stock or value of productive assets.\n",
    "- L: Labor - the number of worker hours.\n",
    "- A: Total Factor Productivity - a measure of the effectiveness with which the two factors of production are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model of production in an economy provides a simple yet effective way of modeling output. It would be way too complicated to account for every possible input to production, especially as we are operating at the country level. However, the key simplication is that we can classify all of these different inputs as either capital or labor: anything physical or tangible is capital and any work done by humans is labor. Taking the monetary value of either of these, while a rough approximation, still yields great insight into the different ways countries produce goods and services. Even if two countries have very similar GDPs, one maybe more capital intensive than the other. Having this knowledge would greatly inform policy and would help governments direct funding towards areas of concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see this in action during Project 1 where we will examine real life data from different countries and compare/contrast their usage of labor, capital and total factor productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplication has allowed economists to derive the following key notion:\n",
    "A nation's output is a function of the amount of the factors of production that are utilized in its economy; that is to say output is a function of labor and capital.\n",

    "Thus, the economy's production function is: $$Y = A \\cdot f(K, L)$$\n",

   "source": [
    "In modern economies, one way to think about TFP is technology or research and development. A country with a high TFP (or technology) can produce far more goods and services than another with a lower TFP but a similar amount of capital and labor. Think about it - a country with 5 factories utilizing robotic arms to assemble cars will be able to produce more than another nation that also has 5 factories but utilizes workers working in 8-hour shifts. The former country would have a higher TFP than the latter. Thus, it can be said that technology increases the efficiency with which the factors of production are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three key differences between TFP and the other two factors of production:\n",
    "1. TFP \"scales\" production by some factor A. The other two are raised to an exponent that is less than 1, reducing its value relative to the input. Thus, TFP is very powerful as it creates a proportional increase in output.\n",
    "2. Technology is \"non-rivalrous\", meaning that more than one person can use it at any given time. For example, robotics technology is not limited to one person, but a specific robotic arm can only be used by a single person at a time.\n",
    "3. Technology is \"non-excludable\", meaning that one person cannot block another from using that factor. Even with the patent system, after expiry, technologies that were once protected now becomes free to use or adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that TFP has no intrinsic value by itself, but becomes informative when it is compared across nations. For example, a TFP of 1.4 means nothing. However, if one country has a TFP of 1.8 while the other is 1.4, then we can say that the first country is more effective at utilizing its resources to produce output."

    "The significance of the exponents adding up to 1, i.e. $\\alpha + \\beta = 1$, is that this implies constant returns to scale. If all inputs are scaled by a common non-zero factor, the output will be scaled by that same factor. Below is a generalization of this:\n",

    "Thus, any increase in either of the inputs will lead to a 1-1 increase in output. This is a significant assumption to make, as it essentially incentivizes companies to continue to \"scale\" their production inputs. They are not losing out on how much return is produced - they are getting output that matches exactly what they put into production.\n",

    "The alternative case is when $\\alpha + \\beta < 1$. This is called decreasing returns to scale, and occurs when a company scales their production inputs by a factor of c, but gets a scaling in output that is less than c.\n",
