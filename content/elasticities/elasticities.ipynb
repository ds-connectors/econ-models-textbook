    "A competitive market is comprised of producers who make goods and services and the consumers who purchase and use them. Through market forces, these consumers and producers agree on a common price for the good or service in question. We will assume that there is no price discrimination and all consumers face the same price. This is typical but not always the case in the real world. Although all consumers face the same market price, consumers are different in how much they individually value a good. We say that consumers have a maximum price that they are willing to pay for a good, and any price marginally higher than this price will dissuade the consumer from participating in the market. This max WTP (willingness to pay) price varies among entities based on their desire for the good, which in turn can be based on how much of the good they already have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the market for electricity. Among consumers we have entities such as households, commercial buildings, factories, and so on. A factory would likely have a very high WTP for electricity because the opportunity costs for factories to not operate are very high. Capital is expensive, employees still have to be paid, and it is inconvenient to have to stop and start up machinery frequently. Thus, for a factory it is preferable to always have a reliable supply of electricity to continue operations and this need is reflected in the WTP. Contrast this with households, who certainly value having electricity, but should electricity become prohibitively expensive, probably would decide to cut back on usage as the drawbacks of not having electricity aren't as severe compared to the factory above."

    "Producers experience a similar characteristic. A producer has a minimum price at which it is willing to produce a good based on its costs. Any market price less than this price would dissuade a producer from supplying its good. Again, in the electricity example, we have several power plants that produce electricity, but each inherently does so at different costs. Imagine and contrast the operating costs of a solar farm with a coal plant, or a newer, more efficient natural gas plant versus an older one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all of these concepts together we arrive at the idea of economic welfare. Suppose electricity costs 10 cents per kWh. On the demand side, imagine a factory who's WTP is 30 cents/kWh. This factory enjoys a consumer surplus of 20 cents/kWh, in other words, it's paying 20 cents less per kWh than what it would be willing to pay. A household might have a WTP of 15 cents/kWh. Here the household's surplus is only 5 cents/kWh. We can also imagine a consumer whose WTP is less than the market price and thus doesn't participate in the market. Imagine for some reason that cryptocurrency prices have dropped to the point that they aren't worth the electricity it takes to mine them. In this case, we might have an idle or non-existent crypto-farm (a place with a lot of computing power) due to electricity being too expensive. On the producer side, maybe we have a solar plant which is operating at the market price, but a natural gas plant that is idling because the price of supplying electricity isn't sufficient to make up for operating costs."

    "Before we continue, let's take a moment to think about the meaning and significance of our findings. Firms that can produce at lower market prices than their peers seem to be better off in the sense that they enjoy higher surplus. This minimum production price is based on the costs of operation the firm experiences, so naturally it seems that firms that can operate at lower costs do better. Certainly, if market prices decrease, more inefficent firms would be the first to shut down while these low operating cost firms continue to do business. This idea is very important in economics: Firms that can reduce their costs are rewarded with higher surplus. This is pretty much how society advances, at least in an economics context. Production methods continually to improve, and less efficient firms must either follow suit or shut down as prices decrease, to the benefit of consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what would the equivalent be for the consumer side of things? We've discussed the idea of willingness to pay, and initially it might seem that in our perfectly-competitive market environment, only the consumers who most need a good or service will be the first to get it, as their WTP is the highest. We might think that resources are efficiently allocated in this way. Most of the time this is likely the case, but we've made an assumption while reaching this conclusion; an assumption that doesn't necessarily hold. We have assumed that a person with high willingness to pay also has at least an equally high *ability* to pay. In reality, this might not be the case. A hungry person might have high WTP for a serving of food, but if this person lacks the means to pay for this food, his willingness to pay won't do him much good. In this scenario, our earlier exercise reflects willingness to pay with a simultaneous ability to pay as well. While this week isn't about the ethics of certain types of markets and whether they achieve their goals, it's important to keep in mind that in these ideal exercises, an efficient economy with rational pricing should reflect consumers' willingness to pay, whereas in reality this might not actually be the case."

    "Imagine that there are two fast food locations next to each other on campus competing for students' business. Let's call them Railway and Bear Express. Initially, their food is priced such that they get equal amounts of business from the students, and students on average don't prefer one over the other; they just want a good and affordable place to eat. Now, imagine that Bear Express raises the prices of their food, while Railway holds their prices steady. In this scenario, one can imagine that students would begin eating more frequently at Railway as opposed to Bear Express due to it being relatively cheaper out of the two options. Now, if Railway in turn increases their prices, the flow of students would shift back to Bear Express by a certain amount. These two restaurants are said to offer goods that are *substitutes* to each other. That is, a consumer will want one or the other, but usually not both. Furthermore, it would seem that just like the price of a good affects its quantity demanded, for substitutes the price of one good can affect the quantity demanded of the other. This is called *cross-price elasticity of demand* (as opposed to *own-price elasticity* that we just learned earlier). It can be defined as follows:\n",

But what about when cross-price elasticity is negative? In other words, are there goods where an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the other? Of course; these are called *complements*. Examples of complementary goods could be cars and gasoline, hot dogs and hot dog buns, or peanut butter and jelly.\n",

These goods are called *normal goods*. More interestingly, there are some goods, called *inferior goods*, for which we see quantity demanded decrease as income increases. An example of this might be frozen, microwaveable food. As consumers grow wealthier and their palates grow more discerning, their consumption of frozen food might decrease in place of more cooked meals.

    "Before we continue to the final section let's make sure we have a solid intuitive grasp of the significance of our findings. Near low price points, a firm deciding how to raise prices will tend to face inelastic demand. You can imagine that if there were some market where let's say laptops cost only a few dollars, doubling the price of laptops would proabalby not decrease demand for laptops at all, since the price of laptops is still very low. Here, demand is inelastic, or in other words, it is less than 1, because a unit change in price is not met by the same change in quantity. Alternatively, if laptops were to cost as much as a house, and then the price for laptops doubled, the few people who were still in the market for laptops would probably be very discouraged from continuing to buy laptops. It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that nearly all of the demand would be lost. Here, demand is elastic, or greater than 1, because a unit change in price is met by an even greater change in quantity. The point of the above exercise is to illustrate that there is some middle ground between these two extremes, where a firm with a good pulse on market demand should be pricing its products.\n",
